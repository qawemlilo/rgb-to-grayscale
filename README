I suck at photoshop so I decided to write an HTML5 application uses the canvas api to edit images to grayscale.

What sucks about the canvas api is the same origin policy that prevents you from manipulating images from another domain.

I created my own hack which uses a php file to fetch the image from a remote server and load it as a local resource.

API

http://apps.rflab.co.za/rgb-to-grayscale/get_image.php?url=<your image url>

Simply replace the url of your external images like as follows:

Before: <img src="http://somedomain.com/images/image.png" />
After: <img src="http://apps.rflab.co.za/rgb-to-grayscale/get_image.php?url=http://somedomain.com/images/image.png" /> 

Once the image loads you are good to go, you can now use the canvas api to manipulate the image.
